# PyOTL

The PyOTL project converts the C++ programs in the [OTL](https://github.com/O-T-L/OTL) into Python modules, and supports both version 2 and version 3 of Python. Moreover, the unit-test technique is adopted to ensure the correctness of all converted Python modules.

Notably, since the standard C++11 is used in the OTL, please check if your compiler supports it.
